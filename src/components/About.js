                  People prefer to buy from companies they can put their faith
                  in. In the modern era, it might not always be enough to just
                  place a product in front of people and hope they would buy it.
                  For you to be able to gain the customers you need to give them
                  something to believe in. Your customers want to feel like they
                  are buying into a movement that says something about
                  themselves. People want to invest in something that has a
                  cause.
